Please cite the following if you plan to use the code in your own work: 
* A fast semidefinite approach to solving binary quadratic problems. P. Wang, C. Shen, A. van den Hengel. CVPR, 2013. 

Tested on MATLAB R2012a.

Installation Notes :

1) Our code relies on the following toolboxes:
   - VLFeat,             http://www.vlfeat.org/;
   - L-bfgs-b,           http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html.
   - Min/Max selection,  http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23576-minmax-selection
   Please install them and add the installation paths into MATLAB.

2) You can now try demo_imgsegm_biased() to generate the results for biased image segmentation in our paper.
