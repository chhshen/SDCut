Tested on MATLAB R2012a.

Installation Notes :

1) Our code relies on the following toolboxes:
   - Normalized Cut,     http://www.timotheecour.com/software/ncut/ncut.html
   - VLFeat,             http://www.vlfeat.org/;
   - L-bfgs-b,           http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html.
   - Min/Max selection,  http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23576-minmax-selection
   Please install them and add the installation paths into MATLAB.

2) You can now try img_cosegm(<data_name>) to generate the results for image co-segmentation in our paper.
